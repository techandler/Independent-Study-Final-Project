        <p>Throughout all of my coding, I used multiple different tools to learn</p>
        <p>the different languages, and I used several different programs to write</p>
        <p>my code. To learn the basics of the languages, I used Codecademy which</p>
        <p>is a website whose goal is to teach coding languages to as many people</p>
        <p>as possible. After learning the basics of the different coding languages,</p>
        <p>for some of them, I had to do additional learning in order to complete</p>
        <p>what I wanted to. I would often do this by watching a youtube video or by</p>
        <p>using w3schools.com. Once I had learned a coding language, I often practiced</p>
        <p>it using a code writing application. I tried out different applications in</p>
        <p>order to see which I liked the most, and which one felt the best to use.</p>
