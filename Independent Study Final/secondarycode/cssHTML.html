        <p>After I had finished learning about HTML, I decided that it would be good</p>
        <p>for me to learn a better way to organize things. I decided that I should</p>
        <p>start learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is a language that can</p>
        <p>control elements on pages, as in the pages you are looking at here. It takes</p>
        <p>the base HTML that one writes, and it makes it look good.</p>
