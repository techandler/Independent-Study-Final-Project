        <p>After learning python, and making a few games, I decided it was time to</p>
        <p>learn another language. I always hear about JavaScript being used for a</p>
        <p>lot of things. So I decided that it would be a great idea to learn JavaScript</p>
        <p>next. Similar to how I approached python, I went through learning the basics</p>
        <p> of JavaScript, then once I understood the basics, I had to learn a bit more</p>
        <p>in order to create a functional game that would work reliably.</p>
