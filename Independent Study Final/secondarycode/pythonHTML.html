        <p>I started out my independent study by learning python. Once I learned some</p>
        <p>basic python code, I went on to learn a library called pygame which</p>
        <p>allowed me to do more interesting things in python. I then proceeded to make
        <p>the game pong. At first, it was tough finding out all of the different codes
        <p>required in order to create a game that worked well. Once I finished pong,
        <p>I started making a new game, this time, with all of the knowledge I gained
        <p>from making pong, it was much easier. I ended up making a game in which the
        <p>player controls an orange car on the bottom of the screen, their goal is
        <p>to dodge oncoming cars and not hit the sidewalk. If you would like to play
        <p>one of these games, they are available in the "Pong" and "CarGame" folders
        <p>inside the "Independent Study Final" folder.
        <p class="comment">(For the choice of single player or two player pong, pick "PongExperiments.py")</p>
