        <p>After finishing basic SQL, I did some more research to see what other</p>
        <p>programming languages were recommended. I found that Ruby was another</p>
        <p>highly recommended language to know. Ruby is like a mixture of SQL, HTML,</p>
        <p>and JavaScript. It is a middle ground to all of these, it is not meant</p>
        <p>to make complex games, but it is not meant to be solely databases. There</p>
        <p>are some other things that Ruby can do that SQL and JavaScript cant.</p>
