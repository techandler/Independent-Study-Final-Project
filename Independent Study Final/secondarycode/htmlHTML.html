        <p>After I learned plenty of python and javascript, I decided that I needed to</p>
        <p>learn a better way to implement these into systems that make them easier</p>
        <p>to get to, and easier to use. I decided that it would be best for me to</p>
        <p>start learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language). This would not allow me to</p>
        <p>put my python applications directly into a browser, but it would allow me to</p>
        <p>neatly insert my javascript applications, so they can be played on a web browser</p>
        <p>like Google Chrome. Everything that you are seeing on this screen is based from</p>
        <p>HTML, it is the foundation of all of the pages.</p>
