        <p>For my coding with python, I only used JetBrains PyCharm. I think that it worked<br/>
          well, allowing me to easily edit my code as well as giving me the ability to<br/>
          test my code directly from the editor. It would then show in the console if<br/>
          there were any issues, and where they were in the code.</p>
          <hr class="space">
        <p>For JavaScript, I tried Code Writer, and Atom. Both of these applications had</br>
          their advantages. Code Writer was a much more simple looking application, that</br>
          the ability to tab multiple lines, and auto tab. Atom had a much more unique look</br>
          that also had many useful tools. Overall, I enjoyed using Atom more, it allowed</br>
          for a customizable look without losing many functions.</p>
          <hr class="space">
        <p>For HTML and CSS, I tried the Code Writer, Brackets, and Atom. Overall, I<br/>
          would say that Atom was my favorite editor. It had great functionality along<br/>
          with an ability to change themes for the editor and syntax. It also had the<br/>
          capability to change basically everything, including making a startup script<br/>
          which would run whenever you opened something.</p>
