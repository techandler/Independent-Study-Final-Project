        <p>After learning a lot about how to make a game, and organize a page to</p>
        <p>display the game and make it playable, I did some research to find out</p>
        <p>other good coding languages to know. I found that knowing SQL (Structured</p>
        <p>Query Language) is highly recommended by many sites. Unlike JavaScript</p>
        <p>and Python, SQL does not make applications that you can play. SQL is more</p>
        <p>of a management tool that can be used to organize databases.</p>
